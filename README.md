# Capstoneproject
Just a simple datbase where you can keep track of crypto prices and volume.

Made a database with sql and linked it to spring tool, while using react for the front end so there can be userinput.
Have a add coin button where you can add.
Have a delete button for deleting entries.
Have a update coin where you can edit existing fields for existing entries.

In the future I want a working thirdparty api so I can track live prices
